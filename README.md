# Hybrid object recognition
Working repo for hybrid reasoning pipeline (ML-based + knowledge-based) 
which integrates two types of posthoc reasoners:
    - a reasoner which can account for the typical size of objects
    - a reasoner which considers the typical Qualitative Spatial Relations (QSRs) between objects 
        
## Getting started

For cloning the code and switching to the test branch:
```
git clone git@github.com:kmi-robots/spatial-KB.git
cd spatial-KB 
git checkout test
```

Installing Python3 dependencies (tested on Ubuntu 20.04):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Data preparation        

You can download the data needed for reproducing our experiments through [this link]().
All data are in a .zip folder and will need to be extracted and prepared as follows:

```

```

## Sample commands

We provide a command line interface that can be run from terminal.
To run experiment A:
