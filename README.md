# Hybrid object recognition
Working repo for hybrid reasoning pipeline (ML-based + knowledge-based) 
which integrates two types of posthoc reasoners:
    - a reasoner which can account for the typical size of objects
    - a reasoner which considers the typical Qualitative Spatial Relations (QSRs) between objects
